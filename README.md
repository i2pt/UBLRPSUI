- Unsupervised segmentation on images of any size
- Works on a smaller dataset

## Code Description

## Dataset 
This dataset contains a subset of 12 images taken with Unmanned Areal Vehicle (UAV) at the Super Rice achievement Transformative Base (SRTB) of the Shenyang Agricultural University (SYAU) in northeastern China during 2017 and 2018.  Filename of Image #1 starts with `I1` and so forth for the following images. The filenames of the original images are ending with `_UAV.jpg`. The rice panicle in each image was manually labeled, and the corresponding manually labeled results of these 12 images have filenames ending with `_MAN.jpg`. This dataset can also be downloaded from [here](https://wuj.hosted.uark.edu/research/datasets/panicle/UBLRPSUI.zip). Information of these 12 images in this dataset is listed as follows.

| I2 | 3m | 810 × 800 |
| I3 | 3m | 1050 × 1075 |  
| I4 | 3m | 1050 × 1050 |  
| I5 | 3m | 1080 × 1040 |  
| I6 | 3m | 1120 × 1070 | 
| I7 | 6m | 415 × 410 |
